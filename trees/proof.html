there is a [[silver gum tree]] in the front yard of a townhouse.
i want to [[stop and stare]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="station" tags="" position="262,336" size="100,100">i am worried that i will miss the [[train]], even though i left home with plenty of time to spare.
time is not something i have befriended. i seldom pay it attention, so it passes without my notice.
i am worried that time speeds up when i am not looking.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="train" tags="" position="262,486" size="100,100">the train takes me to the city.
there are buildings, steely blue.
a silver gum would not stay silver for long.
i wonder how long the silver would hold.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="silver gum tree" tags="" position="412,336" size="100,100">it is not true silver. it glints with a dull green and streaks of grey and brown. 
the branches droop under the weight of their gumnuts. good sized gumnuts. ones i would collect as a child and stuff in my pockets as treasure. but it does not drop its gumnuts lightly.
it has long, elegant leaves, tapering to delicately curved points.
it is a hushed, whispery tree. it is a wise tree; a tree of power. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="stop and stare" tags="" position="532,336" size="100,100">i stop and stare.
it is a witchy tree: it shimmers. beauty. ether. magic.
i stare and stare.
i miss my train. and another.
i lose feeling in my feet.
i stare so long, the rest of the world drops away.
time does not exist.
i can only see the tree.
i only want to see the tree.
i stop blinking. i cannot lose sight of the tree at all. 
i am bound to the tree. it will not let me go.
i do not want it to.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
